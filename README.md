# ![Pokeball](img/pokeball_sm.png) Pikachu Volleyball

**Pikachu Volleyball** is a classic Japanese multiplayer game that was around more than a decade ago at a time when the the world was still using floppy disk to store the game and pass around. It was an .exe and has only been available on Window OS sadly.

This is a remake of the game with JavaScript/HTML/CSS in browser environment.


Pikachu can jump, spike, move around freely.
